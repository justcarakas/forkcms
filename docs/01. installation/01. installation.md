# Installation

## Step 1: Download

PHP Developers using Composer can use this command to install the latest stable release of Fork from the command line:

    composer create-project forkcms/forkcms .

Alternatively, you can install Fork CMS by downloading it from the website.
Before downloading, check if your server meets the [minimum requirements](03.%20minimum_requirements.md) for
Fork CMS. If it does, create a MySQL database and remember the credentials. Next,
[download](http://www.fork-cms.com/download) the latest release and
[unpack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_%28file_format%29) the folder.

## Step 2: Upload

Use an FTP Program like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) (Mac) or [Smart FTP](http://www.smartftp.com/)
(PC) to upload the contents of the folder to the root of the server that will host your website.

Upload the unpacked files into the document_root of your webserver. Make sure you've also copied the
**.htaccess** file, as it may be hidden on certain fileservers.

## Step 3: Installation

You can install Fork CMS by running the command

    forkcms:install:install --env=install

In that case you will need to create a config file in `config/cli-install.yml` based on `config/cli-install.yml.dist`

For example

    config:
        database:
            hostname: db
            username: forkcms
            password: forkcms
            name:  forkcms
        language:
            multiLanguage: true
            languages:
                - en
                - nl
            defaultLanguage: en
        modules:
            install:
                - Localtion
                - FormBuilder

You can set the email and password of the backend user in the yml config, pass it as an option or answer the questions in the cli
`bin/console forkcms:install:install --email=test@test.com --password=internet --env=install`

But if you prefer to install Fork CMS in your browser, you can use our installation wizard for that by surfing to your domain (this should forward you to the Fork CMS installer).
[Follow the steps](02.%20installation_wizard.md) and you're done!
